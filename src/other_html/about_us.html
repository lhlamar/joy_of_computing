      <h1>What is this?</h1>
      <p>
        This is a site that we made for our COMP5620 semester project. The goal
        of this project was to create an interactive learning platform to allow
        students interested in Computer Science to learn some new concepts in a
        new, informative, and fun sort of way.
      </p>
      <h1>How do I use this?</h1>
      <p>
        This site was designed with the intent of being intuitive and easy to
        use, however it's to be expected that maybe that's not the case for
        everyone, and that's okay! To get started, you can select from either
        the home page, or from the navigation at the top of the screen, one of
        the lessons. Once you have chosen your lesson, read through the article
        and then check out the interactive activity at the end of each lesson to
        test and solidify your understanding of the topic.
      </p>
      <h1>Who are we?</h1>
      <p>
        Our names are Lucas Lamar, Jessica Bozkho, and Liz Chatel. We are on the
        Joy and Beauty of Computing team for our class and have designed and
        implemented this site for use of new CS students.

        <p>
          In continuing our discussion of
          <strong>Object-oriented programming</strong>, we’re now going to cover
          an important computer science concept that is present in almost all
          coding languages: <strong>arrays</strong>. An
          <strong>array</strong> is a collection of objects organized in a
          specific order. They help us store and organize large quantities of
          data in a way that is easy to sort and refer to later in our program.
          For most of this discussion, we will consider arrays of integer
          values, but remember that an array can be made of up any type of
          object.

        <p>
          The above example is a simple array. It stores six integer values: 2,
          4, 10, 5, 15, and 3. These values are organized by a specific ‘index’,
          which tells us what position that the value is stored relative to the
          other integers. The integer 2 corresponds to the index ‘0’, the
          integer 4 corresponds to the index ‘1’, and so on. Take note that the
          first index in our array is not 1, but 0. In most coding languages,
          this will be the case. When working on any project, be sure to take
          note if your coding language is irregular in this way – some are. For
          JavaScript, which will be the language this discussion uses most
          frequently, the array index begins at 0. Let’s create the array
          demonstrated above in JavaScript.
        </p>

        <code class="language-java">int my_Array[] = {2, 4, 10, 5, 15, 3}</code>

        <p>
          At the start of our statement, we declare the type of objects in the
          array. Keep in mind that all objects in the array must follow this
          same type. We could make an array of strings, doubles, chars, or even
          our own data structures, like the Book class we defined in the
          Concepts of OOP section of this instructional module. We need to name
          our array as well. Our array is simply named my_Array[]. Note the
          empty closed brackets in our statement. This is how our compiler knows
          that the object we’re creating is an array. Each individual integer
          within our array can be accessed as long as we know the index that the
          integer corresponds to. We call on each value in the array by placing
          the index of the object we’re seeking within the brackets of
          my_Array[].
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-java">int my_Array[] = {2, 4, 10, 5, 15, 3};
int exampleInt;
exampleInt = my_Array[0];		; exampleInt = 2
exampleInt = my_Array[1];		; exampleInt = 4
exampleInt = my_Array[3];		; exampleInt = 10</code></pre>

        <p>
          Although every object in our array needs to be of the same type, we
          can define our array carefully to allow storage of a wider range of
          objects. Instead of defining our array as an integer array, consider
          what it might look like to define our array as a series of variables
          instead:
        </p>

        <code class="language-java">var my_Second_Array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, “Hello”, True, null}</code>

        <p>
          Now, though the first four indexes (which in JavaScript are indexes
          0-3) are still integers, our values stored in indexes 4, 5, and 6 are
          a string, a Boolean, and null respectively. Using these types of
          arrays is slightly more challenging, but useful in rare circumstances.
          The central purpose that arrays serve in our program are to organize
          large quantities of objects, but we might want to manipulate our array
          in specific ways to keep our data organized by specific criteria. Not
          only can we call the values in our array out to other defined
          variables, we can also edit the values in the array after it has been
          defined. Let’s imagine that we wanted to set every value of our
          integer array my_Array[] to 0. The following code would perform this
          task.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-java">int my_Array[] = {2, 4, 10, 5, 15, 3};
int exampleInt;
int my_Array[1] = 0;				; index 1 is set to 0
int my_Array[2] = 0;				; index 2 is set to 0
int my_Array[3] = 0;				; index 3 is set to 0
int my_Array[4] = 0;				; index 4 is set to 0
int my_Array[5] = 0;				; index 5 is set to 0
int my_Array[6] = 0;				; index 6 is set to 0</code></pre>

        <p>
          But we might notice that the process as defined here is inefficient,
          especially if we had an especially large array of integers. To improve
          this process, let’s consider the use of the JavaScript’s .length()
          method. Refer to the discussion on the Concepts of OOP section for
          more information on methods.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-java">int my_Array[] = {2, 4, 10, 5, 15, 3};
int exampleInt = myArray.length();		; exampleInt = 6</code></pre>

        <p>
          Even though our indexes run 0-5, there are still six separate integers
          within my_Array[]. Because of this, my_Array.length() pulls a value of
          6. Let’s use a while loop to make our code that sets each value in
          my_Array[] to 0 more efficient and scalable. To do this, we’ll need to
          define a new integer variable to track the indexes of the array as we
          edit them. Because we start at index 0, this variable will be
          initially defined as 0 and will be incremented by one each time we
          move on to the next index.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-java">int my_Array[] = {2, 4, 10, 5, 15, 3};
int index = 0;
while (index &lt; my_Array.length() ) {
  my_Array[index] = 0;
  index++;
}</code></pre>

        <p>
          Remember that my_Array.length() carries a value of 6. The index will
          move from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, and when the index is incremented to
          6, the while loop will stop, as each of our integers is set to 0. The
          distinction between the length of the array and the maximum index is
          important. Our code will fail if we attempt to replace the integer at
          index 6 with 0, as there is no integer at index 6. This is why we used
          a less than sign instead of a less than or equal to sign in our while
          loop. More information about the usefulness of arrays and a coder’s
          options in manipulating them are available for your perusal in the
          various array sorting methods described in this instructional module.

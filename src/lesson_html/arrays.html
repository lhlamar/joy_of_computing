      <h1>Data Structures - Arrays</h1>
      <div class="lessons-container">
        <p>
          In continuing our discussion of <strong>Object-oriented programming</strong>, we’re 
          now going to cover an important computer science concept that is 
          present in almost all coding languages: <strong>arrays</strong>. An <strong>array</strong> is a 
          collection of objects organized in a specific order. They help us 
          store and organize large quantities of data in a way that is easy 
          to sort and refer to later in our program. For most of this 
          discussion, we will consider arrays of integer values, but remember 
          that an array can be made of up any type of object.
        </p>

        <p>
          picure here
        </p>

        <p>
          The above example is a simple array. It stores six integer values: 2, 
          4, 10, 5, 15, and 3. These values are organized by a specific ‘index’, 
          which tells us what position that the value is stored relative to the 
          other integers. The integer 2 corresponds to the index ‘0’, the integer 
          4 corresponds to the index ‘1’, and so on. Take note that the first index 
          in our array is not 1, but 0. In most coding languages, this will be the 
          case. When working on any project, be sure to take note if your coding 
          language is irregular in this way – some are. For JavaScript, which will 
          be the language this discussion uses most frequently, the array index begins 
          at 0. Let’s create the array demonstrated above in JavaScript.
        </p>

        <code class="language-java">int my_Array[] = {2, 4, 10, 5, 15, 3}</code>

        <p>
          At the start of our statement, we declare the type of objects in the array. 
          Keep in mind that all objects in the array must follow this same type. We could 
          make an array of strings, doubles, chars, or even our own data structures, like 
          the Book class we defined in the Concepts of OOP section of this instructional 
          module. We need to name our array as well. Our array is simply named my_Array[]. 
          Note the empty closed brackets in our statement. This is how our compiler knows 
          that the object we’re creating is an array. Each individual integer within our 
          array can be accessed as long as we know the index that the integer corresponds 
          to. We call on each value in the array by placing the index of the object we’re 
          seeking within the brackets of my_Array[].
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-java">int my_Array[] = {2, 4, 10, 5, 15, 3};
int exampleInt;
exampleInt = my_Array[0];		; exampleInt = 2
exampleInt = my_Array[1];		; exampleInt = 4
exampleInt = my_Array[3];		; exampleInt = 10</code></pre>

        <p>
          Although every object in our array needs to be of the same type, we can define our 
          array carefully to allow storage of a wider range of objects. Instead of defining 
          our array as an integer array, consider what it might look like to define our array 
          as a series of variables instead:
        </p>

        <p>
          third code thing
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, though the first four indexes (which in JavaScript are indexes 0-3) are still 
          integers, our values stored in indexes 4, 5, and 6 are a string, a Boolean, and null 
          respectively. Using these types of arrays is slightly more challenging, but useful in 
          rare circumstances. The central purpose that arrays serve in our program are to organize 
          large quantities of objects, but we might want to manipulate our array in specific ways 
          to keep our data organized by specific criteria. Not only can we call the values in our 
          array out to other defined variables, we can also edit the values in the array after it 
          has been defined. Let’s imagine that we wanted to set every value of our integer array 
          my_Array[] to 0. The following code would perform this task.
        </p>

        <p>
          fourth code thing
        </p>

        <p>
          But we might notice that the process as defined here is inefficient, especially if we had 
          an especially large array of integers. To improve this process, let’s consider the use of 
          the JavaScript’s .length() method. Refer to the discussion on the Concepts of OOP section 
          for more information on methods.
        </p>

        <p>
          fifth code thing
        </p>

        <p>
          Even though our indexes run 0-5, there are still six separate integers within my_Array[]. 
          Because of this, my_Array.length() pulls a value of 6. Let’s use a while loop to make our 
          code that sets each value in my_Array[] to 0 more efficient and scalable. To do this, we’ll 
          need to define a new integer variable to track the indexes of the array as we edit them. 
          Because we start at index 0, this variable will be initially defined as 0 and will be 
          incremented by one each time we move on to the next index.
        </p>

        <p>
          sixth code thing
        </p>

        <p>
          Remember that my_Array.length() carries a value of 6. The index will move from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 
          and 5, and when the index is incremented to 6, the while loop will stop, as each of our integers 
          is set to 0. The distinction between the length of the array and the maximum index is important. 
          Our code will fail if we attempt to replace the integer at index 6 with 0, as there is no integer 
          at index 6. This is why we used a less than sign instead of a less than or equal to sign in our 
          while loop. More information about the usefulness of arrays and a coder’s options in manipulating 
          them are available for your perusal in the various array sorting methods described in this 
          instructional module.

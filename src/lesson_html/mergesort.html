      <h1>Sorting Algorithms - Merge Sort</h1>
      <div class="lessons-container">
        <p>
          Merge sort is one of three processes we will examine in this
          instructional module to help us modify and organize our arrays for
          more convenient reference, along with selection sort and counting
          sort. If selection sort could be considered the least difficult of the
          three, and counting sort the most difficult, then merge sort might be
          called a middle level of difficulty for the sorting methods presented
          in this instructional module. Consider the following array:
        </p>

        <code class="language-java">int my_Array[] = {70, 50, 30, 10, 20, 40, 60};</code>

        <p>
          Let’s imagine we wanted to sort the values in this array in order from
          least to greatest. Merge sort offers one solution. It proposes that we
          recursively separate our array in two until we have a collection of
          single value arrays with a size equal to the length of the original
          array. In this first step, we separate our seven-value array into two.
          However, because we cannot have an array of length three and a half,
          we will instead create one array of length four and another of length
          three, like so:
        </p>

        </pre>

        <p>
          Our next step is to repeat this process for each of our two new
          arrays.
        </p>

        <img src="/MerS_2.png" alt="second split" />

        <p>
          Then, with one final separation, we reach our target state: a
          collection of seven arrays of length one.
        </p>

        <img src="/MerS_3.png" alt="third split" />

        <p>
          We were able to complete this process by separating all of our arrays
          three times, however, many more steps might be necessary to reach this
          initial target state if the array being sorted is significantly
          larger. Our next step is to begin reassembling our small, disparate
          arrays in a sorted fashion. In each progressive assembly step, the
          small arrays are organized from least to greatest, as seen below:
        </p>

        <img src="/MerS_4.png" alt="humpty dumpty back together" />

        <p>
          Note that the number of steps required to join these arrays back into
          a sorted version of the original form is the same number of steps as
          it took to disassemble the original array in the previous section.
          Merge sort is simple, and can easily sort arrays with very large
          numbers, unlike counting sort. However, the length of time that a
          computer takes to apply this process over a very long array is
          significant. Consider the size of your array before making use of
          merge sort.

        <h2>Interactive Activity</h2>
        <p>
          For this activity, let's pretend we are working on writing a merge sort 
          algorithm in JavaScript. Fill in the blank with the correct line of code to 
          complete the merge() function. If you get confused, look back to the lesson 
          for hints on how the algorithm merges the two arrays back together!

void merge(array[], left, midpoint, right) {
  // the two array halves that we are merging together are called L and R
  // to make things simpler, we will omit the code for declaring and filling L and R
  // the size of L is represented by the variable n1, and R by n2

  var i = 0;
  var j = 0;
  var k = left;

  while (i &lt; n1 && j &lt; n2) { //we are iterating through each element in both L and R
    if (______________) { // how do we compare the values of L and R? fill in this line
      array[k] = L[i];

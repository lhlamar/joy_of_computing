      <h1>Object Oriented Programming Concepts</h1>
      <div class="lessons-container">
        <p>
          In <strong>Object-oriented programing (OOP)</strong>, we organize our
          software around data and objects. In Computer Science, an object can
          be a lot of things: a variable or a data structure, to title a few.
          Tackling our coding problems with an object-oriented approach can help
          make our code more reusable, scalable, and efficient. We will now
          discuss the basic building blocks of object-oriented coding. Above we
          listed some forms that objects can take. Imagine for a moment some
          integer variable ‘x’ that you define in your code. ‘X’ is an object.
          We use the term ‘class’ to refer to an object’s type. Your variable
          ‘x’ is within the integer class, and it is therefore an instance of
          the integer class. Objects store our data, and, in the case of ‘x’,
          the data stored is the specific integer value associated with the
          variable.
        </p>
        <code class="language-java">int x = 4</code>
        <p>
          We create an integer variable, which is an object of the integer
          class, and set its value to 4. There are many other types of
          variables, such as strings, doubles, or characters, and, in any case,
          the class of that variable is synonymous with its type. Let’s expand
          our discussion to data structures. A data structure is a specialized
          format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. Our
          code can make use of many data structures, such as arrays, which hold
          a series of objects within a specific order. We will address arrays
          further in our various explanations of sorting algorithms. An array is
          a data structure, and therefore an object. When we define an array, we
          are creating an instance of the array class.
        </p>
        <code class="language-java">int my_array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}</code>
        <p>
          Here we make use of two classes, integer and array. Our array
          organizes the data stored in the integers. Each object, the array and
          every individual integer, has its own type, or class. We can even
          define a class ourselves within our code, assigning it specific
          variables that can be accessed and manipulated using methods. Suppose
          we intended to use JavaScript to create our own class of objects to
          help organize books within a library. ‘Book’ could be the title of our
          class. It would need to store, at the minimum, the title of the book.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-java">public class Book {
      private String title;
    }</code></pre>
        <p>
          Here we outline the basic structure of Book objects that we will
          create in the future. The only thing we care about is the book itself
          and its title, which takes the form of a String variable. We need to
          be able to manipulate our Book object. Say we wanted to change its
          title or call the object to use that title in part of our code. To do
          so, we need to add methods: code that allows instances of our class to
          perform certain actions or tasks using their stored data. Let’s expand
          our Book class with a single method, one that allows it to return the
          title of the book to the user.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-java">public class Book {
    private String title;
    
  // new method
    public String getTitle() {
      return title;
    }
  }</code></pre>
        <p>
          getTitle() now refers to our new method. Imagine we had an instance of
          our Book class called “bookOne,” and its title was “The Very Hungry
          Caterpillar.” We can tell bookOne to perform the action associated
          with our new method. This process is known as calling. Note that in
          the case described, title refers to the string variable stored within
          the object, “The Very Hungry Caterpillar,” and the name refers to the
          object itself, bookOne.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-java">String exampleString;
exampleString = bookOne.getTitle();</code></pre>
        <p>
          Now our exampleString variable will store the string, “The Very Hungry
          Caterpillar.” Methods are an essential piece of Object-oriented
          programming. Whenever we define objects or classes within our code,
          methods are our only way of manipulating them while our code is
          executing. Let’s add an additional method that allows us to change the
          Book’s title.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-java">public class Book {
    private String title;
    
    public String getTitle() {
      return title;
    }
    
    // new method
    public void setTitle(String newTitle) {
      this.title = newTitle;
    }
  }</code></pre>
        <p>
          We’re using a new technique here: within our setTitle method, we have
          a reference to ‘this.title.’ Whenever ‘this’ appears, it instructs the
          object within this class to refer to itself. In this case, the
          setTitle() method tells this instance of Book to refer to its current
          title and replace it with the new title given by the method. One can
          already see the benefits of Object-oriented design in our code before
          the class is complete. There’s a special type of method that we need
          to complete our Book class. In order for it to be useful to us in our
          code, we need to be able to actually create new instances of the Book
          class, otherwise there will be no data to manipulate. The type of
          method that allows us to do this is called a constructor.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-java">public class Book {
    private String title;
    
    // constructor 
    public Book (String title) {
      setTitle(title);
  }
  
    public String getTitle() {
      return title;
    }
    
    public void setTitle(String newTitle) {
      this.title = newTitle;
    }
  }</code></pre>
        <p>
          A constructor defines what variables the user needs to enter into the
          object when it is created. These entries are called parameters. In our
          case, the only parameter is a string that will be assigned as our
          Book’s title. Now that we have a constructor, we can declare an
          instance of our Book class within our code.
        </p>
        <code class="language-java">
          Book bookTwo = newBook(“Horton Hears a Who”);
        </code>
        <p>
          If this line of code is run, a new instance of Book will be created.
          We can access its methods by calling it, as shown below.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-java">String exampleString;
exampleString = bookTwo.getTitle();	
; exampleString = “Horton Hears a Who”
bookTwo.setTitle(“Where the Wild Things Are);
; bookTwo.title = “Where the Wild Things Are”
exampleString = bookTwo.getTitle 			
; exampleString = “Where the Wild Things Are"</code></pre>
        <p>
          Additional methods, variables, Books, and other data structures can
          all be defined to expand our basic library system. In fact, with
          Object-oriented programming, our options are nearly limitless. You
          hopefully now will have some familiarity with the concept itself and
          its usefulness in solving challenges within the world of Computer
          Science.

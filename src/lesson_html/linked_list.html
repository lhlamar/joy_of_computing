        <p>
          A linked list is a data structure similar to an array, except that
          instead of each node having a specific index, it has a 'head' node,
          and then each node has a 'pointer' to the next node in the list.

        <div>
          <p>
            In the above image, the labeled node contains two pieces of
            information, the data, and the pointer. The data just stores
            whatever information is in that node. Similar to how each index in
            an array contains a piece of information. The pointer is a reference
            in memory to where the next node is. That might sound a little
            confusing but this will be demonstrated later in code.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>Let's go ahead and create a java node constructor</div>
        <pre><code class="language-java">class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;

    public Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}</code></pre>
        <div>
          <p>
            So here we're defining a class called Node, which later we will be
            using to create a linked list class. Each one of these nodes is
            constructed with an int data. However, this doesn't have to be an
            int, it can be whatever piece of information your Node needs to
            store. This could be strings, doubles, others objects, and more.
            You'll notice that each one of these nodes also needs to have a
            'next' Node. This is so we can successfully iterate through the
            linked list.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Now we have data structure for our node, we need an additional data
            stucture to store and link these nodes in a useable list.
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-java">class LinkedList {
  Node head;

  public LinkedList() {
      this.head = null;
  }


  // Method to add a new node to the end of the linked list
  public void append(int data) {
      Node newNode = new Node(data);

      if (head == null) {
          head = newNode;
          return;
      }

      Node last = head;
      while (last.next != null) {
          last = last.next;
      }

      last.next = newNode;
  }
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            This LinkedList class is constructed with a head node which will act
            as the first element in our linked list. Additionally, we have
            implemented a method to add nodes to our linked list. This method
            creates a new node, checks to see if there is already a head node in
            our linked list, and if there isn't, makes the new node the head of
            the list. The next chunk of code here is the logic for if the head
            already exists. The block uses the next property of the head node to
            traverse through all the linked nodes in the list, when the code
            detects that there is no next node, the next pointer of the last
            node on the list is set to equal the new node, effecitvely adding a
            node to our linked list.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            Now we have our linked list class as well as our Node class, but we
            don't have a good way to see the contents of our linked list. To fix
            this we're going to write a printList() method. A lot of the time in
            java you might see this method written as toString(). This is the
            conventional way and more common, but we will use printList for now
            for the sake of readability.
          </p>

            Node head;
          
            public LinkedList() {
                this.head = null;
            }
          
          
            // Method to add a new node to the end of the linked list
            public void append(int data) {

            Cool, we've now got all our most basic funcitonality that we need to
            be able to use our LinkedList class in a program. We're going to go
            ahead and write our main and test out our new class to make sure
            everything works the way it should.

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      LinkedList linkedList = new LinkedList();

      // Adding elements to the linked list
      linkedList.append(1);
      linkedList.append(2);
      linkedList.append(3);

      // Printing the linked list
      System.out.println("Linked List:");
      linkedList.printList();

        <h2>Why use linked lists?</h2>
        <p>There are several reasons to use linked lists. The primary being that they are
          dynamic, meaning adding and removing elements from them is fast and cost efficient 
          on your cpu. For example, if you wanted to add an element to a linked list, all you have
          to do is reassign some pointers, wheras if you need to add an element to an array, you have
          to shift over the entire array, which is more resource intensive and not desireable if 
          you have a list of data that is constantly having elements added and subtracted from it.
